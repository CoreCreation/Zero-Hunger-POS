This is a proof of concept web application that was intended to offer online ordering for customers of a pizza shop. Besides the ordering side of the application, it features an admin side that allows for menu creation and display and management of active orders. There are some unfinished features of the application, but the order flow from the client to the store works fine. A working version of the application can be found here: https://zhsws-b5c6d.web.app/
Currently, the application has not been maintained and does not work with the current version of the Ionic Build system. It would need to be updated to be modified. The application uses Firebase for the backend, Auth, Real-Time Database, Storage, and Hosting. It uses Ionic Angular for the frontend. 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
